# DLNLP_24_SN23187901

This project implements a sentiment analysis application using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative.

## Project Overview

The application uses the PyTorch library along with Hugging Face's Transformers to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for the task of sentiment analysis. It demonstrates the process of loading, cleaning, tokenizing data, and training the model using best practices in modern NLP.

## Features

- Load and preprocess the IMDB movie review dataset.
- Use BERT tokenizer for data preparation.
- Train and evaluate the BERT model for sequence classification.
- Utilize GPU acceleration for efficient training.
- Plot results and analyze the model's performance.

## Installation

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
